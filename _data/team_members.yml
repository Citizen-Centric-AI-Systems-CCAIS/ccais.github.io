  # bio: Before joining the Department, Sebastian was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT where he developed 1) new additively manufactured devices whose structure and composition are designed to improve interaction with the human body 2) scalable and sustainable methods for 3D printing cellulose, the world's most abundant organic polymer. He received Ph.D. and Masters degrees in the Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy at the University of Cambridge, where he developed synthesis methods to control the structure and function of nanomaterials. His awards include a UK Academy of Medical Sciences Springboard award, US National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Doctoral Training Grant; MIT Translational Fellowship; and a (Google) X Moonshot Fellowship.

  # bio: Cassi completed her PhD at the University of Cambridge as a joint student of the Analytical Biotechnology group in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology and the Fluids in Advanced Manufacturing group, under the supervision of Dr Lisa Hall and Dr Ronan Daly.  Her work focused on the integration of functional materials, assay development and manufacturing design to enable biosensors to be produced for affordable, rapid, and point-of-care detection of diseases. Prior to starting her PhD, Cassi received her BSE in Bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania and completed a Masters in Bioscience Enterprise at the University of Cambridge, focusing on the commercialization of early stage medical technologies.

  # bio: Dr Xijin Hua obtained his PhD degree from the Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (iMBE) at University of Leeds, where he worked on the stratified design, development and biomechanical analysis of orthopaedic hip implants. He was then working as a research fellow in iMBE, focusing on the biomechanical analysis of articular cartilage in natural hip joint through imaging technique, finite element analysis and parameterised modelling. Before joining the Department, he was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellow in the Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zurich, working on the multiscale computational biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system, soft tissue and hip joint through coupling a multibody dynamics model of the human body, a finite element model of hip joint and articular cartilage, and a finite element model of the fluid flow within hip joint. His awards include a Fully-funded International Research Scholarship, an European Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship, and an Imaged-based Biomedical Modelling Fellowship.

  # bio: Lefan received her PhD degree in Engineering at the Cardiff University in 2018, with her research on the development of wearable sensors for hand motion monitoring. Then she worked as a Postdoc Research Fellow in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds, where she mainly focused on the design of sensing system for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. Tri-axis inductive force sensors were explored and optimised using 3D finite element modelling. A sensing insole with an integration of 64 tri-axis force sensors was designed to measure plantar pressure and shear stress simultaneously. Her awards include International travel grants, Innovative Interdisciplinary Biomedical Engineering Research Development Fellowship, and International Doctoral Scholarship.
